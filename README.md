## Introduction

crewAI is designed to facilitate the collaboration of role-playing AI agents.
This is a collection of examples of different ways to use the crewAI framework with [Obiguard](https://obiguard.ai) to automate the processes.

**Note**: All examples have been standardized to use **CrewAI version 0.130.0** for consistency and compatibility. Some
example may require CrewAI version 0.152.0 or higher, so please check the requirements in each example.

The examples assumes that the following environment variables are set:

- `OBIGUARD_API_KEY`: Your Obiguard API or virtual key. Onboard your account at [Obiguard](https://obiguard.ai).
